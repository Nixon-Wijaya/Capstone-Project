# Capstone-Project
Will be use for Capstone Project

Business Problem:
This project are going to analyze a data-set containing accidents and conditions that given time of the event (road condition, visibility, weather). By means of training different machine learning models, we'll able to predict how these conditions modulate the severity of the collision.

Data Understanding and Preparation
The data used for this project will be extracted from the Collisions set. In order to prepare the data to be feed into the models, we'll drop the columns that contain irrelevant information.
